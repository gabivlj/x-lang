## Xlang

It is a toy interpreter made while learning how to make one.

For the moment it supports:

- Variable declaration
- Arrays
- Strings
- Integers
- Functions
- Passing functions as parameters
- Helper methods like len(), push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), reduce...
- HashMaps

## What's coming

- An online editor which lets you execute code
- Example folder :)

THIS IS ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES. It isn't supposed to go in production or anything like that.
